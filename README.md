# RMF-Artifact-list-creator
Based on NIST 800-53 R5, this creates a full list of artifacts connected to CCI#. 
Meant to be used in conjunction with eMASS, take a copy/paste of an enclave's controls and insert them into the (Control) tab. A complete listing of required artifacts will then be listed on the ( Evidence Needed) tab.
